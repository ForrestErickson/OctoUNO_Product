# OctoUNO_Product
A curver tracer based on Arduino UNO and dispaly on PC with a Proccessing program DISPLAY
Demonstrating also use the Best Widget Ever, a product development template. And idea for a template for doucmentation to help beginners when developing a project / product.

## Project plan for OcotUNO_Product

Folders:  
- firmware, holds Arduino Uno firmware for product and Processing DISPLAY.
- parts, holds specifications for all parts for PCB and enclosure etc. This folder has subfolders and a simple "Parts Master" spread sheet.
- pcb, holds the schematic and PCB design files.
- assembly, holds the folders and files for assembly of the PCB and the BWE.
- testing, holds the test procedure and testing specifications for BWE.

## This project milestones
From start of design to first production.
- 20 July sechmarics drawin in lab notbook cover date "Start 2013" See starting at page 76.
- 21 July bread board up per schematic on page 81. Software composed of UNO firmware and Proccessing Drawing working. Push Software to github at repository: https://github.com/ForrestErickson/OctoUNO

## Future project milestones
 
- Update Drawings for all parts in folders, electrical and mechanical 
- Update parts master to assign PartNumbers
- Schematic release V0.0.1 for initial review
- Review for manufacturing, testing, loading firmware, EMC, signal integerity, power distribution, safety, maximum temprature, ect...
- Update Schematic release V0.0.2 etc...
- Setup PCB software or train self for PCB manufacturing designe rules.

- Schematic approved for start of PCB layout V0.1.xx 
- Enclosure design review. (Make card board mockup, Cable mock up. PCB mockup.) 
- Enclosure design freeze for prototype PCB. PCB outline and connector placement freeze.
- PCB outline import parts and make and connector placement. Make mockup for fit to enclosure
- Milestone: PCB mechanical fit test, (PCB mockup with connector fits enclosure with cables etc...)
- Component placement for optimum routing and heat and Electromatnetic compatibility.  Then route.
- Review by fabricator of PCB against design rules.
- Inventory and order parts including PCB and stencile.
- Assemble first unit(s) and engineering test.
- Engineering revise and relese for rest of Prototype Run. Update of engineering, sales, legal documentation with photographs measurements of real hardware.
- Changes and repeat all of above for Pilot Run (First selleable units with serial numbers etc).
